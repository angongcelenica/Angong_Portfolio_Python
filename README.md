Mini Python Projects

A series of projects that include different variations of user input programmes.

[Project 1 – Creating a random number guessing game:](https://gist.github.com/angongcelenica/693535b5cc9d2b51ffb3b7c6b8c6fadb) 

This code demonstrates how I created a random number guessing game using input functions for the user to type in any number of choice which then generates a reponse on whether they won the game or not.

[Project 2 – Creating a selection menu for a restaurant order:](https://gist.github.com/angongcelenica/c80a53c2391ab99ab1996e8b6ec8db5b)

I coded a User input programme to create a resturant style menu which asks the user what starter, main course, dessert and drink of their choice. The output displays the full order of the customer.

[Project 3 – Creating an interactive programme number game:](https://gist.github.com/angongcelenica/8ea1e8c3e92dd17b71bc960d8c2d3d0e) 

This code shows how to create an interactive number guessing game where the user has to guess any number between 1-100. I programmed the game to have a few selected numbers between 1-100 that will output a joke if the user guessed it correctly and any number outside that selection would not have a joke as the output.

[Project 4 – Coronavirus Home-Testing Kit Eligibilty](https://gist.github.com/angongcelenica/16935023c169e94ff061220cd3b6d9e9) 

This is an example of a flowchart diagram I created to plan, breakdown and visualise the steps to create a User Input Programme. The goal was to create an eligibility criteria for customers to order a Coronavirus Home-Testing kit.

[Project 7 - Yearly motorbike depreciation of 10% until it reaches below £1000](https://gist.github.com/angongcelenica/a49161146cfd4b880d26a99afa1fe4e7)

This code demonstrates a loop programme that will show the 10% yearly depreciation of £2000 until it hits below £1000 of a motorbike.
